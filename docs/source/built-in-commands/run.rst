The ``run`` command is used to execute commands against machines in targetted namespaces.

The following AsciiCast demonstrates the usage of this command:

Like all Bcome commands, 'run' is invoked against all machines in your target namepace, with all connection handling & network discovery handled by the framework.  See 'run' in action against a multi-cloud AWS & GCP inventory:
