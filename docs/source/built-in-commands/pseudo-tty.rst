Pseudo-tty
**********

The ``pseudo-tty`` command allows you to execute a command against a server for which you need an interactive shell.

For example, this could be to tail a log, or to access a remote console, such as a MySQL console.

The following AsciiCast illustrates how to utilise pseudo-tty to execute a 'top' command and then tail a log file:

.. raw:: html

.. note::

   To replay this Asciicast in your own terminal, install the ``asciinema`` package from https://asciinema.org/, and then enter the following in your terminal:

   ``asciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/bYvI2k5i5gXC7oLP9odrmfoZh``
