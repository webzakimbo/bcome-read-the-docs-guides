Ping
****

The ``ping`` command is used to determine whether your SSH configuration functions.  

Like most Bcome commands, it can be invoked against individual servers, or against entire namespaces.

The following AsciiCast demonstrates the usage of this command:

.. raw:: html

   <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/hoa65P4RVyGowcWhwe5mP48QG" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/hoa65P4RVyGowcWhwe5mP48QG.svg" /></a>

.. note::

   To replay this Asciicast in your own terminal, install the ``asciinema`` package from https://asciinema.org/, and then enter the following in your terminal:

   ``asciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/hoa65P4RVyGowcWhwe5mP48QG``
